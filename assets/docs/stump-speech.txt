GENERAL STUMP-STYLE REMARKS (NON-PARTISAN TEMPLATE)

[Opening]
Friends and neighbors, thanks for being here. Across our towns, people work hard, stretch every dollar, and show up for one another. You deserve public leadership that does the same.

[Core Values]
We should deliver accountability you can see, affordability you can feel, and opportunity you can count on. Budgets should be understandable, meetings should be public, and decisions should be explainable.

[Issues]
• Lower everyday costs: find and fix the drivers we control locally—fees, delays, and waste.
• Lower housing costs: faster, predictable timelines for safe building, with fair protections for renters and homeowners.
• Better jobs: skills that match real openings and practical help so small businesses can hire.
• Strong borders: secure, orderly, and lawful—safety and dignity together.
• Protect children / accountability for predators: zero tolerance for exploitation; lawful transparency.

[Shared Responsibility]
This only works if we do it together. Show up. Speak out. Help shape the choices that shape your family’s future.

[Close]
If you believe in open books, fair rules, and real results, let’s build it—together.
