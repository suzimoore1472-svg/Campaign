# Social Messaging Playbook (Non‑Partisan)

**Tone:** clear, constructive, solutions‑oriented
**Pillars:** Accountability • Affordability • Opportunity • Community

## Short Posts (examples)
- Accountability you can see: budgets in plain English, meetings on the calendar, results on a dashboard.
- Lower everyday costs starts with cutting what we control: nuisance fees, slow approvals, waste.
- Better jobs come from better training and fewer roadblocks for small businesses.
- Strong borders and due process can go together—secure, orderly, lawful.
- Protect kids. Pursue predators. Support victims.

## Calls to Participate
- Stand up. Speak out. Help shape what comes next.
- Join a listening session—your ideas → practical plans.
- Volunteer for one hour this month. Neighbors helping neighbors works.
